Here is a post from a social media site about dreams: "<INSERT_DREAM>"

---

Sometimes posts on this site are describing a single dream experience, others describe experiences that occur across dreams more generally. Which one is this?

Respond only with your answer. Say True if the post describes a single dream experience or False if the post is a general dream description.

This is a very important assignment to me, please be careful in your response.
